To this end, you decide to use per capita income as a proxy for the development level, which is defined as the national income divided by the population. You want to use some features in your dataset to predict per capita income. Is this task a classification or a regression task? Why?

The World Bank assigns the world’s economies to four income groups—low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income countries. In each country, factors such as economic growth, inflation, exchange rates, and population growth influence GNI per capita. Revisions to national accounts methods and data can also influence GNI per capita. The mentioned levels have threshold values. So, countries has one level on the based their GNI per capita.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XA7aFvjFYdAj"},"source":["**(2) Which of the following arguments are false and why?**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wy1R3N0WfT1_"},"source":[" \n","\n","1.

Linear regression model is only one kind of regression models. Regression problems can also be solved with other kind of models like Support Vector Machines or Random Forests.\n","  False. Linear regression model is there not to indicate that the fitted line is a linear one but instead to indicate that the linear relationship is between the target variable and the coefficients of the features. In fact, linear regression models can estimate relationships that are quadratic, cubic, or any polynomial order.
